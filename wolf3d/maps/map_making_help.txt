Welcome to the simple map making tutorial

Here are the rules for making a map:

1. W's are walls, so make sure at minimum the edges are all walls
2. .'s are the floor...place them anywhere within the boundary
3. One P is for player starting position...must have one and only one
4. Map size can be anywhere between a 2x2 and a 50x50
5. Only horizontal size of the map can be bigger...won't accept a vertical map.

Have fun being creative!!
